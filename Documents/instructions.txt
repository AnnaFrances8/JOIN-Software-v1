USE INSTRUCTIONS

STITCH OPTION: Combine multiple images to produce a panoramic image or a high-resolution image. Choose your folder containing the single images to stitch. The composed image will appear in the same folder at the end of the process as folder_name_stitched.tif.

RESIZE OPTION: Change the size of your images choosing a suitable scaling factor. Choose your folder containing the images you want to resize and choose a scaling factor for width and height between 0-1. A scaling factor for width of 0.2 is equal to scaling the image to 20% width. In some computers, pop-ups where you can enter the scaling factor will not appear in the screen but minimized with the program in the taskbar. The resized images will appear in your folder at the end of the process as name_resized{extension}in their own folder {folder_name}_Resized images.

SHARP OPTION: Sharpen the details of your image. The sharpened image will appear in the same folder at the end of the process as name_sharpened.tif.
